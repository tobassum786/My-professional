# Create a professional portfolio website.

My name is Tobassum Munir, and I work as a front-end developer professionally. I have been in this field for more than three years. And I'm skilled in *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the newest CSS frameworks, TailwindCSS and Bootstrap*. The client will be able to view my portfolio website and receive the greatest deals I have to offer. Clients will be able to email me, send direct messages on WhatsApp, or interact with me via links to my online marketplace accounts. For my online business, I made this portfolio because I need to be more visible in the market in order to attract more customers.

## Which languages are used on the website?

I will use HTML and Custom CSS coding, and for Animations and transitions, I will use JavaScript. Or for the backend, I will use the Flask Pyton framework.
